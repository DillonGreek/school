                Differences with Rev. 6
                The differences between this Rev. 6 PCB and the Rev. 4 PCB are the following:

                <ui>
                    <li>TRRS jacks for connecting both halves together have been replaced with USB-C</li>
                    <li>Kailh Hotswap Sockets have been added (MX-compatible switches only)</li>
                    <li>Per-key RGB LEDs added</li>
                    <li>2u thumb support removed from Rev. 6</li>
                    <li>Also, due to the replacement of TRRS with USB-C, a different set of plates and case parts are
                        needed, so older parts (Legacy Edition) can not be used. The newer</li>
                    <li>plates/cases (Phoenix Edition) will be compatible with Rev. 5 and Rev. 6.</li>

            <article><b>Item Notes:</b>
                <i>PCBs with on-board controller and USB-C port. Just put in your switches and you're done! The rotary
                    encoder pins are not hotswapped, so encoders need to
                    be soldered in if installing them.
                    About Rev. 6.1 PCBs: Only difference between Rev. 6 and 6.1 is that encoder side legs no longer need
                    to be clipped off if installing encoders.
