            Why I'm Going to College: 
        </h2>
        <p>
           Being self taught makes it hard to land a job, so I want to finish my degree so help get a developer job.

            Why I'm Taking This class:
        </h2>

            A Little About Me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have been writing software for a few years now. I do games, embedded systems, websites, and a lot of data work. 
            I really enjoy scripting trading bots. I hope after school to land a Cloud Developer job.
