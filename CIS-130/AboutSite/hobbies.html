        To Many Hobbies
    </h1>

    <p>
            I have way to many hobbies to pick just one. Since this class is Web Dev, I'll try to stick
        with computer stuff. I have done a little bit of everything, but I really enjoy making 
        keyboards. I'm currently working on a split board thats running 2 Arduino nanos. I just 
        need to finish the code for the split matrix layout. Which is something I have never done
        so its taking a little longer. 
        <br>
            I have 2 new games I'm working on. 1 is a round world PvP thats going on steam
        the other is a Augmented Reality mobile game where you control a stream to fill objects
        around you. 
        <br>
        
            I study a LOT. I have over 300 digital books and a growing collection of paper backs. 
            At the moment Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer are my favorites. I just finished
            The Phoenix Project and highly recommend it. Its not a text book like the others just
            a story told by a project manager.
