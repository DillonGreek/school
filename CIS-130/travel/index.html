            <h2>Alaska and all its greatness.</h2>
            <p>In this awe-inspiring place also known as Alaska, memorable experiences are an everyday occurrence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There’s no denying it: Alaska is one of the most beautiful places on Earth,
                with endless opportunities for play year-round.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Explore the great outdoors, participating in thrilling activities like glacier
                trekking or rafting or more relaxed ventures such as hiking, biking, fishing,
                camping, and simply immersing yourself in breathtaking wide-open spaces. Take
                a train ride, day cruise, or flightseeing tour for chances to spot wildlife,
                from bears to whales. Experience Alaska Native culture through cultural tours
                or festivals. And if you visit in winter, there’s skiing, snowboarding, dog
                sled tours, and more—and don’t miss watching the northern lights dance across
                the night sky. No matter how you choose to get around, from road trips, planes,
                trains, motorcoaches, or cruise ships, you’ll discover that the journey is all
                part of the adventure.</p>
